> Finished Work

**CAD Engineer for Passive Multiphase Acoustic Flow Meter** > Fusion 360, Tig Welding, 3-axis mill
  - Sketched in fusion 360 and welded steel pipe stands for transducer array to reduce the impact of air hammer on the flow loop.
  - Designed output transducer housing in G-code and used 3-axis CNC mill to produce 256 identical parts for high precision fitment.
  - Led a team to design an input transducer mount with fusion 360 with adjustable positioning to reduce strain on input transducer horn.
  - Created a jig to accurately repeat milling of 384 holes into an aluminum U-Channel for the mounting of 128 amplifiers.
  
**Design and Fabrication of a Passive Smart Greenhouse** > Python, Fusion 360
  - Organized grant proposal documents  
  - Designed experimental greenhouse structure
  - Coded thermal energy simulation for greenhouse structure in Python
  - Managed purchasing & logistics for greenhouse components
  - Designed & constructed electronic systems for sensor harness.

**Automated Tracking of Student Activies** > Excell
  - System for automating tracking points associated with student events allowing for minimal management after setup. 
  - This was built to eleminate the time it took for our points chair to manually compile student points for awards at graduation so that the points chair could focus on providing support for students.
